# Finanças Corporativas e Valuation
## Introdução ao Projeto
Este é um repositório para a publicação das notas em LaTeX de aula dos cursos disponibilizados pelo professor Aswath Damodaran em seu <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/@AswathDamodaranonValuation'> canal no youtube </a>
Além disso, a resolução dos exercícios propostos em Python (se possível) e qualquer exemplo prático dado em aula, mesmo que realizado em MS Excel ou Google Planilhas será apresentada a versão em Python.

O motivo para eu começar isso é complementar o projeto <a href='https://github.com/luiz-EL/b3_data'>b3\_data</a> e fundamentá-lo melhor.
